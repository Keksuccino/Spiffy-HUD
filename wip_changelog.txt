CHANGELOG | SPIFFYHUD v3.1.0

- The "Player NBT Data" placeholder now has a refresh cooldown value to control how often the placeholder should update the NBT data
  - Setting higher cooldowns means better performance, but the returned NBT data is not as "realtime" as with lower cooldowns (cooldown of 100ms normally is best for most NBT data)
  - You need to add a new placeholder of that type to see the new cooldown value (existing placeholders still work, but have a cooldown of 0ms by default)
