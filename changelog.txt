CHANGELOG | SPIFFYHUD v3.0.0

It's finally happening! Spiffy got some love!
Over the past few weeks/months, I completely rewrote Spiffy HUD to bring it to the modern standard of all my customization mods.
Spiffy is now and addon for FancyMenu (just like Drippy), which means you can now use almost all of FancyMenu's features in Spiffy HUD (with some exceptions due to what's possible in HUDs).

I also added tons of new features to Spiffy itself and improved all of its old features, like the Slot element, so you can make your HUDs look even greater now!

IMPORTANT:
Sadly all of this also means that old Spiffy LAYOUTS made with versions before v3 will NOT WORK in Spiffy v3 and there is no way around that.
It's a similar situation as the Drippy rewrite. Due to how different old Spiffy worked compared to FancyMenu, there is absolutely no way
to convert old layouts to the new system, so you will need to remake your layouts.
I know this is frustrating, but there's really no way around it, sorry!

I hope you will like all the new features and possibilities! Make sure to share screenshots of your HUDs in Discord! :p

BTW: It is like 100% guaranteed that I will forget stuff in this changelog, because I wrote v3 over a long time and probably do not remember everything I changed and added. Sorry about that!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Complete rewrite of the mod
- Spiffy is now an addon for FancyMenu, which means FM is now a mandatory dependency
- Spiffy v3 is available for Fabric/Forge/NeoForge 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.20.1, 1.21.1 for now
- To customize the HUD, click on the big weird looking button in the Pause screen
- There are now Vanilla-like custom elements for almost every Vanilla HUD element
- Added the "Player Mirror" element which mirrors the client player (including movement, armor, item in hand, etc.)
- Added the "Overlay Remover" element to remove/hide overlay types like pumpkin head overlay, powder snow overlay, world border vignette, etc.
- Added the "Chat Customizer" element to customize parts of the chat overlay
- Added the "Single-Line Text" element which supports Minecraft's JSON component text system for fancy text
  - Good for displaying single-line text in HUDs, because it supports the new placeholders to get the formatted display name of items, etc.
- Added the "Player NBT Helper" element which is basically just an easy way to access all NBT data paths for the client player (useful for some actions and elements)
- Added "Camera Rotation X/Y" placeholders to display the exact camera rotation values on X and Y axes
- Added "Camera Rotation Delta X/Y" placeholders to show the change in camera rotation for precise movement tracking
- Added "Player Position Delta X/Y/Z" placeholders to track player movement changes on all three axes
- Added "Player Item Use Progress" placeholder to get the progress of using an item (eating, drinking, etc.)
- Added "Action Bar Message" placeholder to get the current action bar message text
  - This one is formatted as Minecraft's raw JSON component format, so you can only really use it with the Single-Line Text element
- Added the "Action Bar Message Time" placeholder that returns the remaining display time of the Vanilla action bar message in ticks
- Added "Slot Item Display Name" placeholder to get the display name of items in specific inventory slots
  - This one is formatted as Minecraft's raw JSON component format, so you can only really use it with the "Single-Line Text" element
- Added the "Highlighted Item Time" placeholder that returns the remaining display time of the Vanilla highlighted item text in ticks
- Added the "Player NBT Data" placeholder to access any NBT data values from the client player (use the "Player NBT Helper" element for a list of all data types, etc.)
- Added the "Is Player Using Item" requirement to check if the player is actively using an item (eating food, drinking a potion, etc.)
- Added the "Is Player In Structure" requirement to check if the the player is inside a specific structure (requires Spiffy to be installed on the server!)
- The Slot element now has an entry in its right-click menu to get an explaination of all slot IDs and which ID belongs to which slot
- The Slot element now has toggleable option to show/hide durability
- Added German localization
- Added Japanese localization
- Added Simplified Chinese localization
- Added Korean localization
- Added Spanish (Spain) localization
- Added Spanish (Mexico) localization
- Added Russian localization

- Also keep in mind FancyMenu itself already has tons of placeholders and actions related to the world and player for basically every stat, condition, etc. the world/player offers

KNOWN ISSUES:

Forge 1.21.1 renders HUD textures with transparency as solid black when the Pause screen is open, which is a bug in Forge and I can't do anything about that.
It's not caused by SpiffyHUD. I reported it to the Forge devs already, so for now we can just wait.
